# Submission-System
The National Honor Society and National Math Honor Society form submission system's official repo.

Im sorry for no comments, I promise I will add them if someone ever wants to take a look.

Also am really sorry for the shitty code for some parts, like the server having functions for individual tasks (sending emails, uploading files, ext.) when I could have just made one general function.
I was still kinda learning how to use GoogleAPI and learning how to really code in general but I think I got it now... I THINK.
